# DeploymentAI

## Overview

This project is a simple machine learning application that uses Flask and Docker to serve predictions based on the Iris dataset. A decision tree classifier is trained on the dataset, and the model is deployed using a Flask web application. The application allows users to make predictions through a RESTful API.

## Instructions to Build and Run the Docker Container

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/AbhijeetStudies/DeploymentAI.git cd DeploymentAI

2. **Build the Docker Image**

Run the following command to build the Docker image:

docker build -t deploymentai .

markdown


3. **Run the Docker Container**

Start the Docker container with the following command:

docker run -p 80:80 deploymentai

markdown


The application will be accessible at `http://localhost`.

## Instructions to Test the ML Endpoint

You can test the machine learning endpoint using `curl` or any REST client. Here's an example using `curl`:

1. Open a new terminal window.
2. Run the following command:

curl -X POST http://localhost/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"input": [5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]}'

You should receive a response indicating the predicted class:

{"prediction":0}
